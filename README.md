# JavaSweeper
A minesweeper game made using `Java`. The GUI is made using `Swing`. Created as a practice for getting used to `Java` syntax and OOP again. Might refactor the code again to make it cleaner once all once the minimum viable product is finished.

## TODO
- Reveal all mines upon game over (player clicking on mine location)
- Add gameover state (don't let player click on other spots once a mine is triggered)
- Add victory state (player wins once all non-mine locations are revealed)
- Add right click to flag function (or other ways for player to set a flag)
- Create GUI for retry after winning/losing a game
- Add timer / stopwatch that is displayed to the player
- Add varying difficulties (currently there is only beginner, which is 10 by 10 and 10 mines on the board)
